/ = in progress, x = done, ? = to be discussed, F = charybdis3.1 or next releases

[/] finish legacy code removal
  [x] remove 2.8 report_error() in ratbox imported stuff
  [F] client.c, channel.c is very 2.8 style still. it'd be nice to pack them into their own 
      namespace and such. moreover, the other 2.8 code needs similar rewriting/reworking too...
  ### well, I suggest working on it in 3.1 if you're not against ;)
  [F] rewrite s_auth.c
    [F] authentication state/lock manager
    [F] move resolver/auth checker code into separated modules 
        (or maybe give user ability to run them as ratbox3-style helpers (./configure option)?)
[x] port to libratbox
  [x] get it running
  [x] clean up maxconnections kludges &c
  [x] in-process SSL
  [x] port and use ratbox ssld for server links
[/] ssl stuff
  [x] client-to-client ssl
  [x] server-to-server ssl
  [x] ssl usermode (+Z)
  [x] ssl channelmode (done by extban and chm_compat)
  [ ] acknowledgement message for SSL users like '* *** You are connected using SSL cipher "DHE RSA-AES 128 CBC-SHA"'
  [ ] ssl stuff files generator in ./configure time
[?] merge some stuff from ircd-seven directly (to be determined what)
  [?] remote d:lines support?
  [?] +C (noctcp) channel/usermode
[F] kline/xline/resv sync
[F] make an ability of using bandb instead of .conf files as bans storage
[ ] drop non-TS6 (legacy protocol) support
[F] module engine rework
  [F] more beautiful way of adding new channel modes by module
  [F] make nick/user/host validation functions/match tables able to work in separated modules,
      this will help us making support for native characters sets/slashes in host etc
  [F] auth checker module
  [F] resolver module
[x] Remove glines entirely
[ ] other stuff
  [?] internally split out +o/+v "ranks" into a series of permissions. this could allow for configure-defined 
      special access levels, halfops, etc. (would need to match globally, somehow. extra SVINFO param?)
  [?] somehow hide channel operators like ircnet can do?
  [x] merge m_join.c and m_sjoin.c in one module (same functions, done in ratbox3)
  [x] create chmode.h and put there all declarations of chm_* - this will make some modules clean
