/ = in progress, x = done, ? = to be discussed, F = for future releases

[/] finish legacy code removal
  [x] remove 2.8 report_error() in ratbox imported stuff
  [F] client.c, channel.c is very 2.8 style still. it'd be nice to pack them into their own 
      namespace and such. moreover, the other 2.8 code needs similar rewriting/reworking too...
  [ ] rewrite s_auth.c -> split into three distinct parts
    [ ] authentication state/lock manager
    [ ] identd check
    [ ] dns check
    ### this should be a nice framework to let modules hook the
    ### auth state imo. it'd also be cool to make the DNS checker and
    ### auth checker modules (loaded by default, of course). --nenolod
[x] port to libratbox
  [x] get it running
  [x] clean up maxconnections kludges &c
  [x] in-process SSL
  [x] port and use ratbox ssld for server links
[x] ssl stuff
  [x] client-to-client ssl
  [x] server-to-server ssl
  [x] ssl usermode (+Z)
  [x] ssl channelmode (done by extban and chm_compat)
[ ] merge some stuff from ircd-seven directly (to be determined what)
  [?] remote d:lines support?
  [?] +C (noctcp) channel/usermode
[ ] gk:line/akill syncing
[ ] drop non-TS6 (legacy protocol) support
[ ] module engine rework
  [ ] more beautiful way of adding new channel modes by module
[ ] other stuff
  [?] internally split out +o/+v "ranks" into a series of permissions. this could allow for configure-defined 
      special access levels, halfops, etc. (would need to match globally, somehow. extra SVINFO param?)
  [?] somehow hide channel operators like ircnet can do?
  [x] merge m_join.c and m_sjoin.c in one module (same functions, done in ratbox3)
  [ ] merge s_gline.c and m_gline.c in one module (for pretty look, done in ratbox3)
  [x] create chmode.h and put there all declarations of chm_* - this will make some modules clean
