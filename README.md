# syntaxIRCd

**syntaxIRCd** is a high performance, lightweight, and scalable
IRC daemon. It is a fork of the now-defunct ShadowIRCD and seeks to continue in
the direction ShadowIRCD was headed.

## Supported Platforms

All modern \*NIX systems should work. You need the equivalent of the following
Debian packages:

 - `libssl-dev`
 - `flex`
 - `bison`
 - `build-essential`

## Debian/ubuntu Users

You should run `apt-get update` followed by `apt-get install libssl-dev flex bison build-essential`

Read the included documentation for detailed compilation and install
directions.

## Support

The official channel for syntaxIRCd is `#syntaxIRCd` on
`irc.syntaxnode.co.uk`. 
Please use ***GitHub issue tracker*** for any issues

Atheme and Anope modules are being worked on, and will be released in the next release.

**Denora** works with syntaxIRCd, module being built soon
