ShadowIRCd FAQ
--------------

Q: Why does ShadowIRCd not have remote includes?
A: Remote Includes are a possible security risk due to possible MITM attacks
   and such and do not prevent server owners making changes that you do not
   want them to so they have little point. It is recommended to use rsync or
   a git/hg cron job to pull in remote configuration files.
