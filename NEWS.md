============

syntaxIRCd started as a fork from Elemental-IRCd, since then i've made some changes to suit our networks needs. Things i've changed are listed below;


**Added extensions/ip_cloaking_old.c**

This is an old cloaking module taken from ShadowIRCd, this allows you to set +h on users rather than +x


**Changed Roleplay Channel mode**

Roleplay use to require channel mode +N, however we've now changed this to +U. 

**Changed No nick Change Channel Mode**

This channel mode was set to +d, however most IRCds use as +N. Since we moved **RolePlay** mode we've now moved no nick change to +N
