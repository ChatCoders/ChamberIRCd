News/Changes
============

syntaxIRCd started as a fork from Elemental-IRCd, since then i've made some changes to suit our networks needs. Things i've changed are listed below;


**Added extensions/ip_cloaking_old.c**
This is an old cloaking module taken from ShadowIRCd, this allows you to set +h on users rather than +x
