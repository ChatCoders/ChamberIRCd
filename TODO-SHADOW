Todo list for Shadowircd 6.0
-----------------------------
* swhois support
* custom operstrings (?)
* autochanmodes defined in the .conf (cmodes that are set on a channel on initial join.)
* halfops - probably enabled/disabled via a configure switch on in the .conf
* owner/+a prefix/cmode - see comment for halfops :D
* "soft" callerid umode (+G, only allows PM's from users in the same channel as you)
* Ability for opers to see users' umodes on whois
* blockcaps cmode
* norepeat cmode
* Ability for opers to see secret channels that users are in in their whois
  without needing to use /spywhois or what not.
* kicknorejoin (+J in inspircd chmode)
* operoverride umode (+p), steal this from ircd-seven
* immune cmode (+M), steal this from ircd-seven too


* Anything else we think of between now and release. :P
