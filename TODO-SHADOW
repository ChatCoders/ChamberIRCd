Todo list for Shadowircd 6.0
-----------------------------
* swhois support
* custom operstrings (?)
* halfops - probably enabled/disabled via a configure switch on in the .conf
* owner/+a prefix/cmode - see comment for halfops :D
* norepeat cmode
* kicknorejoin (+J in inspircd chmode)
* operoverride umode (+p), steal this from ircd-seven
* immune cmode (+M), steal this from ircd-seven too
* channel::exemptchanops config option
* host-on-operup: vhost that gets applied to you on oper-up. A surprising number of people want this.


* Anything else we think of between now and release. :P
