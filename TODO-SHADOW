Todo list for Shadowircd 6.0
-----------------------------
* swhois support
* custom operstrings (?)
* autochanmodes defined in the .conf (cmodes that are set on a channel on initial join.)
* halfops - probably enabled/disabled via a configure switch on in the .conf
* owner/+a prefix/cmode - see comment for halfops :D
* "soft" callerid umode (+G, only allows PM's from users in the same channel as you)
* blockcaps cmode
* norepeat cmode
* Ability for opers to see secret channels that users are in in their whois
  without needing to use /spywhois or what not.
* kicknorejoin (+J in inspircd chmode)
* operoverride umode (+p), steal this from ircd-seven
* immune cmode (+M), steal this from ircd-seven too
* config options to strip colours and bold and such from user PART and QUIT messages.
* channel::exemptchanops config option
* nonicks cmode
* host-on-operup: vhost that gets applied to you on oper-up. A surprising number of people want this.
* change *line duration to support "human-readable" format (ie: 3d6h5m)


* Anything else we think of between now and release. :P
