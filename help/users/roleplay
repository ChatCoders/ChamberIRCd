ROLEPLAY consists of a number of similar commands
all of which send messages to channel under 'fake'
nicknames. The user of the command can be identified
by looking at the ident of the 'fake' user - it will
always be the nickname of the person using the command,
and the host will always be npc.fakeuser.invalid.

These commands normally require chanops to run, unless
cmode +x is on the channel in question, in which case
any user that is voiced or above can run any roleplay
command. Cmode +d will prevent any roleplay command
being ran on the channel in question.

Roleplay commands from normal users have the nick
underlined, to clearly show that the message is a 
roleplay message rather than a normal one (with one
exception). Network operators are not subject to this 
restriction. Network operators can also use these
commands in any channel they are in, without requiring
ops.

NPC <nick> <channel> :message
Sends a standard roleplay message to #channel with the 
nick specified. 

NPCA <nick> <channel> :message
Sends an ACTION to #channel with the nick and message
specified. 

SCENE <channel> :message
The same as NPC, except the message always originates
from the nickname =Scene=, which will not be underlined
like the other commands.
