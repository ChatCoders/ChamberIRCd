PRIVS [nick]

PRIVS displays effective operator privileges for
the specified nick, or for yourself if no nick is
given. This includes all privileges from the operator
block, the name of the operator block and those
privileges from the auth block that have an effect
after the initial connection.

If the remote server does not support this
